# Diet Optimizer - New Nutrients Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully added four high-priority nutrients to the diet optimization system:

1. **Vitamin B12** (mcg) - Critical for vegans/vegetarians, nerve function
2. **Folate/Folic Acid** (mcg DFE) - Essential for pregnancy, DNA synthesis
3. **Vitamin E** (mg) - Major antioxidant, often deficient
4. **Vitamin K** (mcg) - Bone health, blood clotting

## Changes Made

### 1. Models (`app/models/`)

#### request.py
- Added fields to `Food` model:
  - `vitamin_b12_per_100g` (float, mcg)
  - `folate_per_100g` (float, mcg DFE)
  - `vitamin_e_per_100g` (float, mg)
  - `vitamin_k_per_100g` (float, mcg)

- Added fields to `NutritionalConstraints` model with RDA values:
  - `min_vitamin_b12` / `max_vitamin_b12` (2.4 mcg RDA)
  - `min_folate` / `max_folate` (400 mcg DFE RDA, 600 for pregnancy)
  - `min_vitamin_e` / `max_vitamin_e` (15 mg RDA)
  - `min_vitamin_k` / `max_vitamin_k` (90-120 mcg RDA)

- Added validation methods for each new nutrient

#### response.py
- Added fields to `NutritionalSummary`:
  - `total_vitamin_b12`
  - `total_folate`
  - `total_vitamin_e`
  - `total_vitamin_k`

- Added fields to `ConstraintSatisfaction`:
  - `vitamin_b12_within_bounds`
  - `folate_within_bounds`
  - `vitamin_e_within_bounds`
  - `vitamin_k_within_bounds`

### 2. Services (`app/services/optimizer.py`)

- Updated nutrition matrix from 15 to 19 nutrients
- Added new nutrients to constraint arrays
- Updated constraint matrix size from 30 to 38 (19 nutrients × 2 bounds)
- Added calculations for new nutrient totals
- Added constraint satisfaction checks for new nutrients

### 3. API Router (`app/routers/optimization.py`)

- Updated documentation from "12 total" to "19 total" nutrients
- Added new nutrients to API documentation with units
- Updated example request/response to include new nutrients
- Fixed infeasible/unbounded response objects to include new nutrients

### 4. Example Usage (`example_usage.py`)

- Added realistic nutrient values for all 10 example foods
- Updated all constraint sets:
  - Basic constraints
  - Density constraints
  - Pregnancy constraints (600 mcg folate)
  - Heart-healthy constraints

### 5. Tests (`tests/test_optimizer_service.py`)

- Added new nutrients to test foods
- Updated constraint matrix test from 24 to 38 constraints
- Added zinc constraints (was missing)
- Updated test constraints to include new nutrients

### 6. Documentation (`README.md`)

- Added new nutrients to supported nutrients list
- Updated unit warning to include new nutrients
- Added dedicated section for "Recently Added High-Priority Nutrients" with:
  - RDA values
  - Upper limits
  - Health benefits

## Nutrient Values Used

### Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA)
- **Vitamin B12**: 2.4 mcg (2.6 mcg pregnancy)
- **Folate**: 400 mcg DFE (600 mcg pregnancy)
- **Vitamin E**: 15 mg
- **Vitamin K**: 90 mcg (women), 120 mcg (men)

### Upper Limits
- **Vitamin B12**: No established limit (safe at high doses)
- **Folate**: 1000 mcg DFE (from supplements)
- **Vitamin E**: 1000 mg
- **Vitamin K**: No established limit (from food)

## Testing Confirmation

✅ Unit tests pass with updated constraint matrix
✅ API successfully optimizes with new nutrients
✅ Nutritional calculations include all new nutrients
✅ Constraint satisfaction properly tracks new nutrients

## API Example

Successfully tested optimization with spinach and chicken breast, confirming:
- All four new nutrients are calculated
- Constraint satisfaction includes new nutrients
- Total cost optimization works with 19 nutrients
