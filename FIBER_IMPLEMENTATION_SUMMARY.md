# Fiber Nutrient Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to add fiber as the 12th nutrient to the Diet Optimizer API.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Request Models** (`app/models/request.py`)
- Added `fiber_per_100g` field to the `Food` model (measured in grams)
- Added `min_fiber` and `max_fiber` fields to the `NutritionalConstraints` model
- Added fiber validation to ensure `max_fiber > min_fiber`
- Updated model examples to include fiber values

### 2. **Response Models** (`app/models/response.py`)
- Added `total_fiber` field to the `NutritionalSummary` model
- Added `fiber_within_bounds` field to the `ConstraintSatisfaction` model

### 3. **Optimization Service** (`app/services/optimizer.py`)
- Added fiber to the validation checks in `_validate_inputs` method
- Updated the nutrition matrix from 11 to 12 nutrients, including fiber
- Added fiber to the constraint bounds arrays (both min and max)
- Added fiber calculation in the `_process_result` method
- Added fiber constraint satisfaction check

### 4. **API Router** (`app/routers/optimization.py`)
- Updated API documentation from "11 nutrients" to "12 nutrients"
- Added fiber to the list of supported macronutrients
- Updated example requests to include fiber values
- Updated error response templates to include fiber fields

### 5. **Main Application** (`app/main.py`)
- Updated documentation from 11 to 12 nutrients
- Added fiber to the macronutrients list with description
- Added fiber to the example food item
- Added fiber to the RDA reference table (25-38g recommended, 70g upper limit)
- Updated optimization algorithm documentation to reflect 12 nutrients

### 6. **README Documentation**
- Updated feature list from 11 to 12 nutrients
- Added fiber to the supported nutrients list
- Added fiber to the RDA table
- Updated mathematical formulation to mention 12 nutrients

### 7. **Example Usage** (`example_usage.py`)
- Added realistic fiber values to all sample foods:
  - Chicken Breast: 0g
  - Salmon: 0g
  - Brown Rice: 1.8g
  - Quinoa: 7g
  - Spinach: 2.2g
  - Broccoli: 2.6g
  - Sweet Potato: 3g
  - Greek Yogurt: 0g
  - Almonds: 12.5g
  - Orange: 2.4g
- Added fiber constraints to all diet profiles:
  - Standard Adult: 25-70g
  - Pregnancy: 28-70g
  - Heart-Healthy: 35-70g (higher for cardiovascular benefits)

### 8. **Test Updates**
- Updated `test_optimization.py`:
  - Added fiber values to all test food items
  - Added fiber constraints to all test constraint sets
- Updated `test_optimizer_service.py`:
  - Added fiber_per_100g parameter to all Food constructors
  - Added fiber constraints to NutritionalConstraints

### 9. **Test Script**
- Created `test_fiber_support.py` to demonstrate fiber optimization with high-fiber foods

## Fiber Guidelines Implemented

- **Units**: Grams (g)
- **Adult RDA**: 25-38g daily
- **Upper Limit**: 70g daily
- **Pregnancy**: 28g minimum (higher needs)
- **Heart-Healthy**: 35g minimum (for cardiovascular benefits)

## Key Implementation Notes

1. **Consistency**: Fiber follows the same pattern as other macronutrients (protein, carbs, fat) in terms of units (grams)
2. **Validation**: All fiber values must be non-negative, and max_fiber must be greater than min_fiber
3. **Algorithm**: Fiber is treated as the 12th constraint in the linear programming optimization
4. **Documentation**: All API documentation, examples, and error messages have been updated to include fiber

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Unit tests passing with fiber constraints
- Infeasible problem tests updated to include fiber
- Manual test script created to verify fiber optimization works correctly

## Backward Compatibility

**Note**: This is a breaking change for API clients as all requests must now include fiber values in both foods and constraints. Clients will need to update their request payloads to include:
- `fiber_per_100g` for each food item
- `min_fiber` and `max_fiber` in constraints
